# Create a Python script that is able to convert a set of audio clips in MP3 format to WAV format and save it in the output folder mentioned. Argument 1 is the MP3 files folder and argument 2 is the destination folder where wav files are saved.

## In this script, we define a function mp3_to_wav that takes two arguments: mp3_folder (the path to the folder containing the MP3 files) and wav_folder (the path to the folder where the WAV files will be saved). Inside the function, we use the os library to loop over all the files in mp3_folder and check if each file has a ".mp3" extension. For each MP3 file, we use pydub to load the audio and then export it as a WAV file with the same name in wav_folder. Finally, we call the mp3_to_wav function with example paths to the input and output folders, which you can modify to fit your own file paths.
